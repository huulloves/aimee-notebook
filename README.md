# aimee (working name)

**aimee** will be a local-first thought processor with a rich terminal UI and built-in LLM-powered semantic linking between notes.

it helps you capture, explore, and interconnect your thoughts—without ever touching the cloud.

## core idea

- write your thoughts in plain text.
- a local AI reads and structures them.
- a graph of ideas emerges—automatically.

no tags. no backlinks. no manual linking.

just thought → file → meaning → map

## features (planned)

- terminal UI (TUI) with panels for notes, graph, and prompts
- local markdown note storage
- automatic semantic connections between notes
- fast, local LLM processing using quantized models
- offline, zero telemetry, zero cloud

## tech stack

current python, tkinter, sqlite

will implement gpg securtiy chain or equivalent to secure user database

## status

early development phase. no guarantees.  
feel free to watch, fork, or build alongside :)
