# aimee (working name)

**aimee** will be a local-first thought processor with a rich terminal UI and built-in LLM-powered semantic linking between notes.

it will help you capture, explore, and interconnect your thoughts...all without ever touching the cloud. sounds pretty alright, right?

## core idea

- write your thoughts in plain text.
- a local AI reads and structures them. will ask you deeper questions using socratic reasoning and questioning methods. this will be a feature of the speak + whisperer functionality
- a graph of ideas emerges automatically. this will be a feature of the distill functionality

no tags. no backlinks. no manual linking.

just thought → file → meaning → map

## features (planned)

- terminal UI (TUI) with panels for notes, graph, and prompts
- local markdown note storage
- automatic semantic connections between notes
- fast, local LLM processing using quantized models
- offline, zero telemetry, zero cloud

## tech stack

current python, tkinter, sqlite (for prototyping)

will implement security chain + docs to secure user database and empower users on their local systems equipped with the aimee notebook.

## status

early development phase. no guarantees, things are still very much breaking!!.  
though feel free to watch, fork, or build alongside :)
